**Goal:** Admin gets a lead, clicks ONE button, and sends the beautiful Course Invite + Payment QR code.

---

## Part 1: Installing the "Superpower"

1.  **Open Chrome** on your Desktop/Laptop (this works best on Computer).
2.  Go to the **Chrome Web Store**.
3.  Search for **"WAPlus - CRM for WhatsApp"** (or Cooby/WA Web Plus).
4.  Click **"Add to Chrome"**.
5.  Open **web.whatsapp.com** and scan your QR code to login.
6.  *You will now see new Tabs (All, Unread, Business) and sidebar tools.*

## Part 2: Setting Up the "Payment Card" Response

We don't want to type messages every time. We want a "Saved Reply".

### Step 1: Prepare your Asset
1.  Open the file `payment_invite.html` (I created this for you).
2.  **Take a Screenshot** of it on your phone or computer.
    *   *Why?* Sending an image is more engaging than a link, and QR codes work best in images.
3.  Save the image as `Course_Invite_Card.png`.

### Step 2: Create the Quick Reply
1.  In WhatsApp Web, look for the **WAPlus Sidebar** (usually on the right).
2.  Click the **"Quick Replies"** (Bolt icon) or **"Smart Replies"**.
3.  Click **"+ Add Reply"**.
4.  **Name:** `Invite_GenAI`
5.  **Message Text:**
    > "Hi! 👋 Thanks for your interest in the GenAI Institute.
    >
    > We have reserved a slot for you.
    > 📅 **Duration:** 12 Weeks
    > 🎓 **Format:** Live + Asynchronous
    >
    > Please scan the QR code in the image below to complete your enrollment securely via our LMS.
    >
    > Or click here: https://learn.greybrain.ai"
6.  **Attachment:** Upload your `Course_Invite_Card.png`.
7.  **Save.**

## Part 3: The 3-Second Workflow (How Admin Uses It)

**Scenario:** Dr. Sharma messages "I want to join."

1.  **Open Chat:** Admin opens Dr. Sharma's chat.
2.  **Type `/`**: Type a forward slash in the message box.
3.  **Select `Invite_GenAI`**: The list pops up. Click your saved template.
4.  **Send:**
    *   Dr. Sharma instantly gets:
        1.  The Professional "Digital Invite Card" Image.
        2.  The QR Code (in the image).
        3.  The Text Link.
5.  **Tag User:**
    *   Click the **Tag Icon** (top of chat).
    *   Select **"Sent Payment Link"**.

## Why this is better than manual?
1.  **Consistency:** Every user gets the same premium experience.
2.  **Speed:** Takes 3 seconds instead of 3 minutes.
3.  **Professionalism:** The "Invite Card" image looks like an official university admission letter, not just a random chat message.
