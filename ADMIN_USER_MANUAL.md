## PART 1: The "Write Once, Publish Everywhere" Workflow

We treat **Medium** as our "Source of Truth" (where the content lives), and LinkedIn/Chats as our "Megaphones" (where we shout about it).

### Step 1: Publishing on Medium (The Hub)
1.  **Login** to Medium.
2.  Go to **"Publications"** -> Click **"GreyBrain"**.
3.  Click **"Write a Story"**.
4.  **Drafting:** Write your article.
    *   *Pro Tip:* Use a great main image (Unsplash is built-in).
5.  **Tagging (Crucial):** Before publishing, click "Publish" and add **Tags**.
    *   Use `Artificial Intelligence`, `Medicine`, AND one of our 3 category tags: `ClinicalAI`, `Soul`, or `Lens`.
    *   *Note:* The category tag ensures it goes to the right tab on our homepage.
6.  **Hit Publish.** Copy the URL of your new article.

### Step 2: The LinkedIn Newsletter (The Email Blast)
1.  Go to **LinkedIn** (Personal Profile or Page).
2.  Click **"Write Article"** (Not "Start a Post").
3.  **Select Newsletter:** Click the dropdown at the top and select **"GreyBrain Intelligence"** (You need to set this up once).
4.  **Content:**
    *   **Headline:** Same as Medium.
    *   **Body:** You can copy-paste the whole Medium article here.
    *   **Or (Better):** Paste the first 3 paragraphs (The Teaser) + "Read the full Deep Dive here: [Link to Medium]".
5.  **Hit Publish.**
    *   *Magic:* LinkedIn automatically Emails this to all your subscribers.

### Step 3: The WhatsApp/Telegram Broadcast (The Signal)
1.  **The Message:** Write a short, punchy summary (3-4 lines).
    *   *Example:* "🚨 New Drop: How GenAI changes Radiology. The 3 things you need to know today. Read now: [Medium Link]"
2.  **Telegram Channel:** Post this message to your public channel.
3.  **WhatsApp "Broadcast List":**
    *   Open WhatsApp on your phone.
    *   Go to **Broadcast Lists**.
    *   Select your "GreyBrain Updates" list.
    *   Paste and Send.
    *   *Note:* This sends a private DM to everyone at once.

## PART 2: WhatsApp CRM Management (Daily Routine)

**Goal:** Manage leads without getting overwhelmed.

### Setup (One Time)

2.  Install **"WAPlus"** (or Cooby) Extension.

### The Daily Flow

**Scenario 1: A New Lead Appears**
1.  You get a WhatsApp message: *"Hi, interested in the course."*
2.  **Click the Tag icon** (from the extension) next to their chat.
3.  Select **"🔥 Lead"**.

    *   Select `/brochure` -> It auto-fills the brochure link text.

**Scenario 2: They Pay**
1.  User sends screenshot of payment.
2.  **Change Tag:** Click the tag icon, change from "Lead" to **"✅ Student"**.
3.  **Add to Database:**
