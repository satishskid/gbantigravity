## 1. Website Capabilities Audit (SEO & Tech)

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR SCALE**

We have upgraded the website's technical foundation to support a global audience.
*   **Dynamic Meta Tags:** Every page (ClinicalAI, Soul, Academy) now generates specific "Open Graph" cards.
    *   *Result:* When you share `greybrain.ai/clinical-ai` on WhatsApp/LinkedIn, it won't just say "GreyBrain". It will say **"ClinicalAI | Upgrade Your Biological Intelligence"** with a specific image.
*   **Semantic Structure:** The site uses proper `H1/H2` tags, which Google requires to understand your "Hubs" (Clinical vs Soul).
*   **Performance:** React + Vite ensures sub-second load times, a key ranking factor for Google Mobile Indexing.

**Action Item for Admin:**
*   Ensure every new page uses the `<SEO />` component with a unique `title` and `description`.

## 2. Content Strategy: "The Unified Field"

Since we have distinct verticals (Medical Science vs. Spiritual Philosophy), the risk is **Brand Fragmentation**.
**The Fix:** The "Biological Intelligence" Narrative.

*   **The Core Narrative:** "GreyBrain is not two things (Health & Soul). It is ONE thing: **Upgrading Human Intelligence.**"
    *   **ClinicalAI** upgrades your *Professional Intelligence* (Work).
    *   **Soul** upgrades your *Inner Intelligence* (Reflect).
    *   **Academy** upgrades your *Technical Intelligence* (Build).

**The Guideline:**
*   **Tone:** "Compassionate Authority".
    *   *Clinical:* Precise, Evidence-Based, Protocol-driven.
    *   *Soul:* Reflective, Timeless, Question-driven.
*   **Visuals:** Use the Dark/Lab aesthetic for Clinical, and Light/Serene aesthetic for Soul (Implemented).

## 3. Founder Brand Strategy (LinkedIn & Twitter)

**Objective:** Position the Founder as a **"Polymath Innovator"** (Scientist-Doctor-Builder).

**The "3-Hat" Routine:**

### Hat 1: The Doctor-Scientist (Tue/Thu)
*   **Platform:** LinkedIn (Primary), Twitter (Secondary)
*   **Topic:** Hard clinical evidence, AI model benchmarks, "How I used Gemini to diagnose X".
*   **Format:** "Case Study" style.
*   **Hook:** "Radiologists are using AI wrong. Here is the protocol."

### Hat 2: The Spiritual Thinker (Sun)
*   **Platform:** Twitter (Primary), LinkedIn (Secondary)
*   **Topic:** Consciousness, Burnout, The Ethics of AI, "What remains human?".
*   **Format:** Long-form reflection (Essay).
*   **Hook:** "We are building Gods, but we have forgotten how to be Human."

### Hat 3: The Builder/Innovator (Fri)
*   **Platform:** Twitter & LinkedIn (Equal)
*   **Topic:** "Shipping" updates. New features in GreyWaken, New cohorts in Academy.
*   **Format:** Video Demos / Screenshots / "Building in Public".
*   **Content:** Show the *tools*, not just the *theory*.

## 4. The "Viral Loop" Ecosystem

1.  **Top of Funnel (Discovery):**
    *   Founder posts a **LinkedIn Case Study** (Hat 1).
    *   *Call to Action:* "Download the full protocol on GreyBrain."
2.  **Middle of Funnel (Capture):**
    *   User lands on `greybrain.ai/clinical-ai`.
    *   Sees the "Active Protocol" card -> Clicks "Join Academy".
    *   OR: Clicks "Subscribe" -> Tally Form -> Google Sheet (Lead).
3.  **Bottom of Funnel ( Conversion):**
    *   Admin sends the **WhatsApp Payment Card** (WAPlus).
    *   User joins **Telegram Channel** for daily updates.

**Conclusion:**
The infrastructure is built. The strategy is defined. Now, **Execute**.
